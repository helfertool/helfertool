    n-m relation between helper and shift.

    This model then can be used by other apps to "attach" more data with OneToOne fields and signals.

    The fields `present` and `manual_presence` belong to the gifts app. They are directly inserted here as it
    would be too complicated to add another model for just two booleans. Additionally, this has the advantage
    that the `present` flag can directly used by other apps.

        :timestamp: Timestamp when the helper registered for this shift
        :present: Flag set when the helper is there (manually or automatically)
